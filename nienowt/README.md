Create a C(reate) R(ead) U(pdate) D(estroy) interface for your two resource JSON api using Angular. When doing an data transation, don't refetch the entire list, just insert the returned new object or remove the object from the list. Also, make sure that when you cancel your edit it shows the original value (don't just use a getAll()).

CRUD: 4pts

Lean client data updating: 3pts

Edit Cancel Button: 3pts

Stretch: Automate your build process with gulp, add Angular form validations,  cover up the Angular flash (when the page loads and you can still see brackets).
